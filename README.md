# Drivvu: Car Rental Project

Welcome to the **Drivvu Car Rental Project**, a collaborative full-stack development endeavor completed during our Elective course. Our team of five worked together to build this web application aimed at streamlining car rental services. My primary contribution focused on designing simple landing pages for vehicle selection and creating brochure features for respective vehicle models.

> Note: Due to access limitations, the entire project's raw code is not available in this repository. However, snapshots showcasing key functionalities are included below. Additionally, the vehicle selection template file `AVANZA.php` has been provided.
